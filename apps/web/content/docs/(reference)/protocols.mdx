title: TCP & UDP Tunnels
description: Open non-HTTP services over TCP or UDP with the OutRay CLI.
---

OutRay can tunnel raw TCP and UDP traffic so you can share things like SSH, databases, syslog, or game servers.

## TCP: expose any TCP service (SSH, DB, etc.)

```bash
outray tcp 22 --remote-port 2222
```

**What happens**

- We try to bind the requested remote port; if it’s taken, you’ll see the assigned port in the output.
- External TCP clients connect to the assigned port; traffic is piped to your local port.

**Flags that matter**

- `<port>`: local TCP service to forward to.
- `--remote-port <port>` (optional): ask for a specific public port in the TCP pool (defaults 20000-30000). If it’s busy, we assign another.

## UDP: expose UDP services (DNS, syslog, game servers, etc.)

```bash
outray udp 514 --remote-port 1514
```

**What happens**

- We try to bind the requested UDP port; if busy, you’ll get the assigned port (UDP pool defaults 30001-40000).
- External UDP packets to the assigned port are forwarded to your local UDP service; your responses are relayed back.

**Flags that matter**

- `<port>` (positional): local UDP service to forward to.
- `--remote-port <port>` (optional): ask for a specific public port in the UDP pool.

## Quick troubleshooting

- **Port already in use**: retry without `--remote-port` to let OutRay pick one, or choose another.
- **No responses (UDP)**: ensure your local service replies; the CLI relays responses automatically once it receives them.
