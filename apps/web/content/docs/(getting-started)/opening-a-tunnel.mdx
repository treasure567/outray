Once you are authenticated, you can start exposing your local services to the internet.

## Basic Usage

To expose a local server running on a specific port (e.g., 3000), simply run:

```bash
outray 3000
```

You will see an output similar to this:

```bash
✨ Connecting to OutRay...
🔌 Linked to your local port 3000
🌐 Tunnel ready: https://random-name.tunnel.outray.app
🥹 Don't close this or I'll cry softly.
```

Now, anyone with the public URL can access your local server.

## Using Configuration Files

For managing multiple tunnels, you can use a TOML configuration file. Create an `outray/config.toml` file in your project directory:

```toml
[tunnel.web]
protocol = "http"
local_port = 3000
subdomain = "my-app"

[tunnel.api]
protocol = "http"
local_port = 8000
subdomain = "api"
```

Then start all tunnels at once:

```bash
outray start
```

You can validate your config file before starting:

```bash
outray validate-config
```

See the [CLI Reference](/docs/reference/cli-reference#configuration-files) for complete configuration options.

## Inspecting Traffic

OutRay provides a real-time view of requests and responses in your terminal. As requests come in, you will see the method, path, and status code.

## Stopping the Tunnel

To stop the tunnel, simply press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal. This will close the connection and the public URL will no longer be accessible.
